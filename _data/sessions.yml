  title: "Deep Learning, Predictability, and Optimal Portfolio Returns"
  description: "Authors: Mykola Babiak and Jozef Barunik<br/>
  <p>Abstract: We study dynamic portfolio choice of a long-horizon investor who uses deep learning methods to predict equity returns when forming optimal portfolios. Our results show statistically and economically significant benefits from using deep learning to form optimal portfolios through certainty equivalent returns and Sharpe ratios. Return predictability via deep learning also generates substantially improved portfolio performance across different subsamples, particularly during recessionary periods. These gains are robust to including transaction costs, short-selling and borrowing constraints.</p>"

  title: "Coins with benefits: on existence, pricing kernel and risk premium of cryptocurrencies"
  description: "Authors: Cathy Yi-Hsuan Chen and Dmitri Vinogradov<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Cryptocurrencies come with benefits, such as anonymity of payments, and transaction risks, such as unconfirmed transfers, hacks, and frauds.
  They compete with central-bank-regulated currencies as a means of payment but this competition is not perfect: consumers are not indifferent with respect to the currency to be used in transactions.
  We consider an arbitrage-free world in which consumers derive utility both from consumption and from the benefits offered by the type of the currency: for example, preserving anonymity may increase the
  utility of consumption, while a fraud would decrease it. Distinct stochastic processes governing benefits of the two currencies generate incomplete markets with crypto- and central bank currencies
  operating under distinct pricing kernels. We characterise, both theoretically and empirically, the bitcoin kernel and its relationship with the pricing kernel in the centralized market.
  Using the fundamental pricing relationship, we suggest a method to empirically evaluate the otherwise unobservable benefits, and show their contribution to the pricing kernel is well proxied
  by the flow of coins over the cryptocurrency network. The model explains both the co-existence of digital and centralized currencies and the risk and return patterns in the cryptocurrency world.</p>"

  title: "Empirical Risk Minimization for Time Series: Nonparametric Performance Bounds for Prediction"
  description: "Authors: Christian Brownlees and Jordi Llorens-Terrazas<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Empirical risk minimization is a standard principle for choosing algorithms in learning theory. In this paper we study the properties of empirical risk minimization for time series. The analysis is carried out in a general framework that covers different types of forecasting applications encountered in the literature. We are concerned with 1-step-ahead prediction of a univariate time series generated by a parameter-driven process. A class of recursive algorithms is available to forecast the time series. The algorithms are recursive in the sense that the forecast produced in a given period is a function of the lagged values of the forecast and of the time series. The relationship between the generating mechanism of the time series and the class of algorithms is unspecified. Our main result establishes that the algorithm chosen by empirical risk minimization achieves asymptotically the optimal predictive performance that is attainable within the class of algorithms.</p>"

  title: "Dynamic Density Forecasting Using Machine Learning"
  description: "Authors: Lubos Hanus and Jozef Barunik<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  The use of machine learning techniques is proposed to describe and forecast the conditional probability distribution of asset returns. We redefine the problem of forecasting of conditional probabilities looking from a different perspective than traditional ordered binary choice models. Using deep learning methods, we offer a better description of asset returns distribution. The study on the most liquid U.S. stocks shows that predictive performance of machine learning methods is promising out-of-sample. We provide a comparison of machine learning methods to the unordered and order binary choice models used by the literature.</p>"

    description: "Authors:  Petra Laketa, Stanislav Nagy and Dusan Pokorny<br/>
    <p>Abstract: Let $R^d$ be the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space and $mu$ a finite Borel measure on $R^d$.
    A halfspace depth of a given point $x$ with respect to $mu$ is defined as the infimum of $mu$-masses of
    all the closed halfspaces that contain $x$. As such, it measures the centrality of $x$ with respect to $mu$
    and is used as a multivariate quantile. The notion of the halfspace depth found also application in machine
    learning. The existing literature on this interesting topic usually imposes restrictive assumptions on
    measure $mu$. We consider halfspace depth in general setting, for all finite Borel measures, with intention
    to collect partial results from the literature and give more general theoretical results. We specially focus
    on 1) when and how is it possible to reconstruct the underlying measure based on its halfspace depth function
    and 2) extending the so-called ray basis theorem, which gives an interesting characterization of the point
    with the maximal halfspace depth, called the halfspace median. </p>"

    title: "Compressed time series text regression"
    description: "Authors:  Daniel Mittendorf<br/>
    <p>Abstract: We propose a procedure to model the time-varying relationship between a univariate response and a high-dimensional predictor set derived from textual data. In such settings, standard shrinkage approaches such as lasso can encounter computational and numerical issues. While text-specific regression approaches such as multinomial inverse regression and hurdle regression have been developed, these methods allow for neither time-varying parameters nor heteroskedasticity. Our proposed method first performs several random projections of the predictor matrix to a much lower-dimensional linear subspace. For each of these compressed predictor sets, a time-varying parameter state space model is estimated using fast Kalman filter recursions, allowing for heteroskedasticity in the response. These models' predictions are then averaged dynamically using Bayesian posterior model probabilities. The resulting procedure remains stable with hundreds of thousands of predictors and is trivially parallelisable. Intuitive variable importance measures can be computed naturally with little additional computational cost. </p>"
