  title: "Dynamic Network Perspective of Cryptocurrencies"
  description: "Authors: Li Guo, Yubo Tao and Wolfgang K. Härdle<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Cryptocurrencies are becoming an attractive asset class and are the focus of recent
  quantitative research. The joint dynamics of the cryptocurrency market yields information on network risk.
  Utilizing the adaptive LASSO approach, we build a dynamic network of cryptocurrencies and model the latent
  communities with a dynamic stochastic blockmodel. We develop a dynamic covariate-assisted spectral
  clustering method to uniformly estimate the latent group membership of cryptocurrencies consistently.
  We show that return inter-predictability and crypto characteristics, including hashing algorithms
  and proof types, jointly determine the crypto market segmentation. Based on this classification result,
  it is natural to employ eigenvector centrality to identify a cryptocurrency’s idiosyncratic risk.
  n asset pricing analysis finds that a cross-sectional portfolio with a higher centrality earns a
  higher risk premium. Further tests confirm that centrality serves as a risk factor well and delivers
  valuable information content on cryptocurrency markets.</p>"

  title: "Asset Pricing using Time-Frequency Dependent Network Centrality"
  description: "Authors: Jozef Barunik, Michael Ellington<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  A framework is provided where time-frequency dependent network centrality links to expected excess return of financial assets. Noting that investors trade on different horizons, it is essential to understand how the connectedness of a system influences risk premium over the short-, medium- and long-term. Viewing the market as being generated by a time-varying parameter VAR model implies that a shock to the $j$-th asset is time-frequency dependent. This creates a network of time-frequency connections among all assets in the market. We propose a new measure of time-frequency dependent network centrality and apply this to all stocks listed on the S&P500. Our findings indicate that our time-frequency dependent measures significantly price assets; particularly over the longer-term.</p>"

  title: "Portfolio enhancement based on DARA stochastic dominance"
  description: "Authors: Milos Kopa, Thierry Post<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Portfolio optimization based on Stochastic Dominance (SD) is
theoretically appealing, for investment strategies with asymmetric
risk profiles such as equity price reversal and momentum plays.
Most studies in this area are based on the second-order stochastic
dominance (SSD) criterion. Unfortunately, SSD has limited
discriminatory power, because it requires unanimity among all
global risk averters, including those with implausible attitudes
towards higher-order risk. SSD optimization therefore often produces
solutions which are suboptimal for all standard utility functions.To
improve the power of the analysis, the paper develops a portfolio
optimization method based on Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion
Stochastic Dominance (DSD). DSD is known to be more powerful than
alternative dominance criteria in several related financial applications
and it is generated by the most restrictive class of utility functions
acceptable to most economists.The proposed optimization method improves
upon the performance of Mean- Variance optimization by tens to
hundreds of basis points per annum, for low to medium risk
levels. The improvements critically depend on imposing Decreasing
Absolute Risk Aversion instead of Global Risk Aversion or
Decreasing Risk Aversion. </p>"

  improving efficiency, we propose a grouping estimator to account for the potential spatial correlation in

  description: "Authors: Yongshi Jie and Yinggang Zhou<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  This paper examines whether systemic risk of cross-border lending network can propagate to
  risk spillover network of global stock market. We find that the stock market risk spillover network is more
  stable (fragile) if the cross-border lending network becomes more diversified when the shock is small (big)
   enough. Moreover, the higher the ratio of cross-border lending to the GDP of the countries which borrow,
   the bigger impact of risk spillover on the countries which lend more. Finally, the exponential random graph
   model (ERGM) is used to interpret the relationship between two networks. The connections in cross-border
   lending network have a significantly positive on the likelihood of spillover effect relations in global

  title: "Micro Forecasting"
  description: 'Authors: Matus Maciak, Ostap Okhrin, Michal Pesta<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Forecasting costs is now a front burner in empirical economics. We propose an unconventional tool for stochastic
  prediction of future expenses based on individual (micro) developments of recorded events. Let us think of a firm, enterprise,
  institution, or state, which possesses knowledge about particular historical events. For each event, there are several related
  payments or losses spread over time. Nevertheless, the issue is that some already occurred events do not have to be necessarily
  reported. The aim lies in forecasting future cash flows coming from already reported, occurred but not reported, and yet not occurred
  events. Our methodology is illustrated on quantitative risk assessment, however, it can be applied to other areas such as startups,
  epidemics, war damages, advertising and commercials, credit cards, or prescription behavior of general practitioners as discussed in
  the paper. As a theoretical contribution, stochastic inference for marked non-homogeneous Poisson process with non homogeneous Poisson
  processes as marks is developed.</p>'

  title: "Utility Based Model Selection and Model Averaging (Including ML Models)"
  description: 'Authors: Robert Navratil, Jan Vecer<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  This talks presents a novel approach to model selection and model
averaging based on economic theory. We study a model prediction in the
form of a distributional opinion about a random variable $X$. We show
how to test this prediction against any alternative views. Different
model opinions can be traded on a hypothetical market that trades their
differences. Using utility maximization technique, we describe such a
market for any general random variable $X$ and any utility function $U$.
We specify the optimal behavior of agents and the total market that
aggregates all available opinions and show that a correct distributional
opinion realizes profit in expectation against any other opinion, giving
a novel technique for model selection. Analytical solutions are
available for random variables from exponential family. We determine the
distribution corresponding to the aggregated view of all available
opinions, giving a novel technique for model averaging.</p>'

  title: "Nuisance-parameter-free changepoint detections"
  description: 'Authors: Michal Pesta<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Many changepoint detection procedures rely on the estimation of nuisance
parameters (like long-run variance). If a change has occurred,
estimators might be biased and data-adaptive rules for the choice of
tuning parameters might not work as expected. If the data is not
stationary, this becomes more challenging. The aim of this paper is to
present two changepoint tests, which involve neither nuisance nor tuning
parameters. This is achieved by combing self-normalization and wild
bootstrap. We investigate the asymptotic behavior and show the
consistency of the bootstrap under the hypothesis as well as under the
alternative, assuming mild conditions on the weak dependence of the time
series. As a by-product, a changepoint estimator is introduced and its
consistency is proved. The results are illustrated through a simulation
study. The new completely data-driven tests are applied to real data
examples from finance and hydrology.</p>'

  is to get a highly reliable solution with respect to the realizations

  of scenarios. We propose a novel method based on the stochastic gradient
  descent which performs updates of the decision variable based only on
  looking at a few scenarios. We modify it to handle the non-separable objective.
  A complexity analysis and a comparison with the standard (batch) gradient
  descent method is provided. We give three examples with non-convex data which
  include optimal design of gas network with random demand and stochastic optimal
  control of electrostatic separator. We show that our method provides a good

  title: "Resampling methods in change point analysis "
  description: 'Authors: Zuzana Prášková<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Critical values of change point tests in linear/panel data models are
usually based on  limit distribution of the respective test statistics
under the null hypothesis. However, the limit distribution is  very
often a functional of a Gaussian process and depends on unknown
quantities  that cannot be easily estimated. In many situations,
convergence to the asymptotic distribution is rather slow  and the
asymptotic critical values are not well applicable in small and
moderate  size samples. It has appeared that resampling methods provide
reasonable approximations for critical values of test statistics for
detection changes in linear models.
Dependent wild bootstrap is a resampling procedure for dependent data
that has been developed as an alternative to existing block-bootstrap
methods with the aim to mimic the dependency structure of the analyzed
data not only in the blocks but in the whole sample. A variant of this
method is proposed to approximate critical values of  test statistics
for detection a change in a dynamic panel data model with
cross-sectional dependence.</p>'

  title: "RatingBot: A Text Mining Based Rating Approach"
  ##### WANTS TO PRESENT SEP 30 MONDAY !!!!
  description: 'Authors: Diana Hristova<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Credit risk is at the core of banking business and its adequate measurement is crucial for financial institutions.
  Due to lack of historical default data and heterogeneity of customers, qualitative expert-based information
  is an important factor in measuring the creditworthiness of large companies. However, such information is
  often extracted manually, causing inefficiencies and possible subjectivity. The RatingBot is a text mining
  based rating approach, which efficiently and objectively models relevant qualitative information based
  on annual reports. It combines both the literature on text mining in finance and machine learning in c
  redit rating to derive the credit rating of a company. The approach is evaluated on two datasets:
  a publicly available one that facilitates replicability, and a dataset provided by a major
  European bank representing real-world scenario. The results show that RatingBot delivers additional
  predictive power and should be considered in future research on credit rating models.</p>'

  title: "Rating Ordinality in ML Based Credit Models"
  description: "Authors: Steffen Thesdorf<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  The credit rating as a measure of a company's ability to pay back its liabilities is a crucial information source, e.g. for bond investors. There have been numerous attempts to
  reproduce credit ratings by objective models, that is without any (presumably costly) expert judgment. A comprehensive literature review of studies on corporate credit rating models reveals that a wide
  range of flexible machine learning models are applied to the credit rating domain which however usually neglect the rating ordinality. The objective of present study is to find an answer to the
  question whether the consideration of the order information improves the prediction performance of the rating models. The Ordinal Pairwise Partitioning (OPP) approach is shown to be a straightforward
  enhancement to allow a nominal classification model to account for output ordinality. The nominal classification versions of the machine learning models are hence compared with their OPP counterparts
  by applying all models to a Deutsche Bank dataset. The results are ambiguous. Whereas Ordered Partitions (OP), as one variant of OPP, proves to promote the prediction accuracy, the OPP variants
  One-vs-Followers (OVF) and One-vs-Next (OVN) yield inferior outcomes.</p>"

  title: "Testing for neglected nonlinearity in the conditional quantile using neural networks"
  description: "Authors: Georg Keilbar, Weining Wang<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Neural networks have proved to achieve tremendous success in a large number of prediction problems.
  Unfortunately, this success comes at the expense of imposing challenges for the interpretation of models and for
  conducting inference in general. In this paper, we propose a test for neglected nonlinearity in the conditional
  quantile by comparing the fit of a linear model to an alternative model constructed as a neural network series
  estimator. The problem can be formulated as a significance test of the output weight parameters of the neural
  network in the presence of nuisance parameters under the alternative. We provide consistency and asymptotic
  normality of the neural network series estimator. We propose three test statistics as functions of a Wald
  process depending on the nuisance parameters the average, the exponential average and the supremum Wald
  statistic. Critical values can be simulated. Simulations show that our test has proper size and good power.
  An application to analysis of systemic risk in a financial network indicates an important role of neglected
  nonlinearity.</p>"

  title: "Heterogeneous Treatment Effects through Tenure on Job Satisfaction: A
Machine Learning Evaluation."
  description: "Authors: Daniel Jacob<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Scientists who give lectures or seminars might be more prone to developing new ideas for their research through the interaction with students during their teaching activities. In this paper, I estimate heterogeneous treatment effects of teaching on the perceived degree of intellectual challenge of scientists using data from the National Science Foundation (NSF). To provide as much information about the causal effects as possible and also to control for a potential selection-bias, I expand the idea of making inference on key features of heterogeneous effects sorted by impact groups (GATES), to non-randomised experiments. This is achieved through the implementation of a doubly-robust estimator. Cross-splitting with multiple iter- ations is a further extension to avoid biases introduced through sample splitting. The advantage of the proposed method is the robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects which is comparable with other models and thus keeps its flexibility in the choice of machine learning methods and at the same time its ability to deliver interpretable results. The empirical findings support the hypothesis that teaching activities, conducted by scientists, have a causal effect on the satisfaction with the job’s intellectual challenge. The difference in the satisfaction (scaled from 1 for very dissatisfied to 4 for very satisfied) is 0.14 between the most and least affected scientists. I conduct a classification analysis to provide insight into the average values of such key features, again for the most and least affected. Finally, I estimate the conditional average treatment effect for each individual, which allows making predic- tions of the treatment effect for new scientists. I find that there is heterogeneity in the treatment effect which is positive for the majority and negative for some scientists.</p>"

Using machine learning methods, we predict quantiles of individual stock returns obtaining the whole forecasted distributions. We document heterogeneity in models parameters across different quantiles. We show that forecasting all quantiles together, using multi-task deep learning is better than forecasting quantiles individually. The forecasting models allow us to construct portfolios based on the whole distribution instead of just a conditional mean. We show the economic value added of looking at the whole forecasted distribution by forming quantile-based long-short portfolios, as well as favourably forecasting value-at-risk.</p>"

  title: "Uniform Inference in High-dimensional Gaussian Graphical Models"
  description: "Authors: Sven Klaassen, Jannis Kueck, Martin Spindler and Victor Chernozhukov<br/>
  <p>Abstract:  Graphical models have become a very popular tool for representing dependencies within a
  large set of variables and are key for representing causal structures. We provide results for uniform
  inference on high-dimensional graphical models with the number of target parameters d being
  possible much larger than sample size. This is in particular important when certain features or
  structures of a causal model should be recovered. Our results highlight how in high- dimensional
  settings graphical models can be estimated and recovered with modern machine learning methods in
  complex data sets. To con- struct simultaneous confidence regions on many target parameters, sufficiently
  fast estimation rates of the nuisance functions are crucial. In this context, we establish uniform
  estimation rates and sparsity guarantees of the square-root estimator in a random design under
  approximate sparsity conditions that might be of independent inter- est for related problems in
  high-dimensions. We also demonstrate in a comprehensive simulation study that our procedure has
  good small sample properties.</p>"

  <p>Abstract:  The market for cryptocurrencies is a very dynamic market with high volatility movements and
discontinuities from large jumps. We investigate the risk-management perspective when selling securities written on cryptocurrencies. To this day, options written on cryptocurrencies are not officially exchange-traded. This study mimics the dynamics of cryptocurrency markets in a simulation study. We assume that the asset follows the stochastic volatility with correlated jumps model and price options with parameters calibrated on the CRIX, a cryptocurrency index
that serves as a representative of market movements. We investigate on risk-management opportunities of hedging options written on cryptocurrencies and evaluated the hedge performance under misspecified models. The hedge models are misspecified in the manner that they include fewer sources of randomness. We hedge with the industry-standard Black-Scholes option pricing model, the Heston Stochastic volatility model, and the Merton jump-diffusion model. We perform delta-hedging. We report poor hedges when calibration is poor. The results show a good performance in hedging with the Black-Scholes model and the Heston model. The study outlines the poor performance of the Merton model. We observe large unhedgeable losses in the left tail and consider these losses to result from large jumps.</p>"

In this work we introduce a novel approach to supervised domain adaptation consisting in a class-dependent fitting based on ideas from optimal transportation (OT) theory which considers 𝑆 and 𝑇 as two mixtures of distributions. A parametrized OT distance is used as a fidelity measure between 𝑆 and 𝑇, providing a toolbox for modelling of possibly independent perturbations of mixture components.

    title: "Optimal Interest Rate Decision for a Consumer Loan "
    description: "Authors: Tomas Rusy<br/>
    <p>Abstract:  In this study, we present a stochastic programming
    asset-liability management model which deals with decision-dependent
    randomness. The model is designed to answer a question that is
    frequently asked by many (multinational) companies - what is the 'best'
    interest rate that a company should offer to a customer for a loan and
    how should it be financed? In determining the answer, we must consider
    numerous factors. These include the possibility of the customer
    rejecting the loan, the possibility of the customer defaulting on the
    loan and the possibility of prepayment. Moreover, these random effects
    have a clear relationship with the offered interest rate of the loan,
    which induces decision-dependent randomness. Another important factor,
    which plays a major role for liabilities, is the price of money at the
    market. This is determined by the corresponding market
    interest rate and we capture its evolution in the form of a scenario
    tree. In the presentation, we will formulate a non-linear, multi-stage,
    decision-dependent randomness stochastic program which will span over
    the lifetime of a typical consumer loan. Its solution will show us the
    optimal decisions the company should make. In addition, we will also
    show a sensitivity analysis demonstrating the results of the model for
    various parameter settings describing different types of customer.
    Finally, we will discuss the losses caused in the event that companies
    do not act in the optimal way.</p>"

    constraints"
    description: "Authors: Karel Kozmik<br/>
    <p>Abstract:  We use modern approach of stochastic dominance in portfolio optimization, where we
    want the portfolio to dominate a benchmark. Since the distribution of returns is often just estimated
    from data, we look for the worst distribution that differs from empirical distribution at maximum by
    a predefined value. First, we define in what sense the distribution is the worst for the first and
    second order stochastic dominance. For the second order stochastic dominance, we use two different
    formulations for the worst case. We derive the robust stochastic dominance test for all the mentioned
    approaches and find the worst case distribution as the optimal solution of a non-linear maximization
    problem. Then we derive programs to maximize an objective function over the weights of the portfolio
    with robust stochastic dominance in constraints. We consider robustness either in returns or in probabilities
    for both the first and the second order stochastic dominance. To the best of our knowledge nobody was able
    to derive such program before. We apply all the derived optimization programs to real life data, specifically
    to returns of assets captured by Dow Jones Industrial Average, and we analyze the problems in detail using
    optimal solutions of the optimization programs with multiple setups. The portfolios calculated using
    robustness in returns turned out to outperform the classical approach without robustness in an out-of-sample analysis.</p>"

    title: "Random Forest Estimation of the Ordered Choice Model"
    description: "Authors: Michael Lechner and Gabriel Okasa<br/>
    <p>Abstract:  In econometrics so-called ordered choice models are popular when
    interest is in the estimation of the probabilities of particular values of categorical
    outcome variables with an inherent ordering, conditional on covariates. In this paper
    we develop a new machine learning estimator based on the random forest algorithm for
    such models without imposing any distributional assumptions. The proposed Ordered Forest
    estimator provides a flexible estimation method of the conditional choice probabilities
    that can naturally deal with nonlinearities in the data, while taking the ordering information
    explicitly into account. In addition to common machine learning estimators, it enables the estimation
    of marginal effects as well as conducting inference thereof and thus providing the same output as
    classical econometric estimators based on ordered logit or probit models. An extensive simulation
    study examines the finite sample properties of the Ordered Forest and reveals its good predictive performance,
    particularly in settings with multicollinearity among the predictors and non-linear functional forms.
    An empirical application further illustrates the estimation of the marginal effects and their standard
    errors and demonstrates the advantages of the flexible estimation compared to a parametric benchmark model.</p>"
